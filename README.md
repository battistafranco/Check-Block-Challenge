# CheckBlockChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.4.

I choose the Angular Framework because I got everything in one place with a simple installation, Http client, Tests, Routing, etc.

## Getting started

1 - You need to have NodeJS and NPM installed. Can be dowloaded from: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2 - When installation Completes, clone the repo.

3 - Open the code, go to the root folder in any IDE.

4 - Run in a command line `npm install` to install dependencies.

5 - Run in a command line `ng serve -o` for a dev server in `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will be automatically opened in a browser.

6 - Run in a command line `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
